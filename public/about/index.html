         <h1>About me</h1>
         <p>Hi there, I am Wong Chun Sing, some may know me as Gallerieboii.  I am a Gallerist/Carpenter based in Hong  Kong.  Let me tell you something about me.</p>
<p><img src="/img/propic2021.png" alt="This is me"></p>
<h4 id="gallery-and-art-spaces-in-hong-kong-and-taiwan">Gallery and Art Spaces in Hong Kong and Taiwan</h4>
<p>In my five years of working in the contemporary art gallery industry.  I curated and coordinated over 20 gallery exhibitions in the gallery from 2017 to 2021. Having the privilege of working with the uprising contemporary artist in Hong Kong, I develop incredible interest and a sense of mission to promote local artists and bring them to the center stage of the art world.  In the journey of participating in international major art fairs, I can curate exhibitions to present local artists on a big stage on a limited budget.  Some of the major art fairs I put my effort in are <strong>Art Basel Hong Kong</strong>, Art021 Shanghai 2018, the inaugural edition of Ink Now Taipei 2019, Asia Now 2019, and the inaugural edition of Frame Hong Kong 2019. Some of the collectors include a museum, Taiwanese art foundations, well known collectors from Korea and Japan,and first-time art collectors in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I was given the chance to supervise the inaugural of several art spaces in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  In 2018,  I supervised the refurbishment of <strong>A.M. Space</strong> and manage the transition to <strong>A Concept Gallery</strong>.  I did a systematic transition in terms of the hardware and software of the gallery.  Furthermore, I was appointed as the gallery coordinator of the gallery and coordinated eight exhibitions until the hiatus of the gallery operation due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>I was appointed to supervise the unification of a.m. space to its parent company Art Map Ltd.  I liaised with the users of the space to design a productive workspace for the publishing and gallery operations.  The relocation increases the gallery space by 50%.  I subsequently curated an invited exhibition featuring 12 local contemporary ink artists.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the new space in Hong Kong, I participated in the preparation of the new compound space in Taiwan called <strong>Yanben</strong>.  It is an art space with a cafe, a hostel, and a gallery.  I participated in recruitment, interior design, and procurement in Hong Kong.  To establish the operations in Tainan, I was deployed in December 2020.  During my first three months, we broke the single-day revenue record of the space 3 times.  Establishing the business revenue model and improving on interior decoration with local architects.   I curated 3 exhibitions, organized 3 workshops, and coordinated 1 concert during my six-month stay, established standard operating procedures for cafe, hostel, and gallery business, and trained more than ten employees.  I was invited by a local university to talk about the business model of the company.</p>

<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p>I graduated in the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2017 for the award of the degree of Bachelor of Arts with Honours, First Class. My major subject was Fine Arts (Stream: Art History and Art Studio).</p>
