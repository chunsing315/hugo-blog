      <description>There is some problem when I try to push the project to git hub. I followed the Video &amp;lsquo;Understanding the Jamstack: How to build a blog with Hugo, Netlify CMS and Zapier, by How to Code on Youtube.
I created a Github account. Added a repository called &amp;ldquo;hugo-site&amp;rdquo;. Then, there is a series of command, which I don&amp;rsquo;t know the function.
I shall probably look at the hugo documentation on Deploying on Github.</description>

      <description>Downloaded Hugo, a static website generator, to update my learning, woodworking and others. Mainly in the form of blog posts. Want to get things out fast. Letting people see fast.
So basically, there is no log in system. No users. No Database. I guess the more complicated stuffs will go to my wiki page. https://wiki.gallerieboii.sbs
Anyways, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be an internet peasant anymore. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to update this blog from time to time.</description>
