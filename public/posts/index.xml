      <description>Implementing Netlify CMS is as easy as adding two files, i.e. config.yaml and index.html to the /admin folder in the /static folder. However, some of my posts where not properly displayed and I do not know if this post will go to the correct place, i.e. /content/posts or not. I guess we will find out in the next post.
Problems now:
  Feature image is required
  weight is required.</description>

About the entire sculpture camp project, I am very grateful for the experience.

      <description>So I did the &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page. I believe there was a serious syntax error when I amended the about markdown file. I tried to copy the _index.md file in the example site. It worked. So, I just copy the whole thing again. That&amp;rsquo;s not a high level problem though.
And I deployed the hugo site on the Netlify server. To be clear, compiled the files in hugo locally (at the predator), push the site folder onto my git hub repository.</description>

      <description>There is some problem when I try to push the project to git hub. I followed the Video &amp;lsquo;Understanding the Jamstack: How to build a blog with Hugo, Netlify CMS and Zapier, by How to Code on Youtube.
I created a Github account. Added a repository called &amp;ldquo;hugo-site&amp;rdquo;. Then, there is a series of command, which I don&amp;rsquo;t know the function.
I shall probably look at the hugo documentation on Deploying on Github.</description>

      <description>Downloaded Hugo, a static website generator, to update my learning, woodworking and others. Mainly in the form of blog posts. Want to get things out fast. Letting people see fast.
So basically, there is no log in system. No users. No Database. I guess the more complicated stuffs will go to my wiki page. https://wiki.gallerieboii.sbs
Anyways, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be an internet peasant anymore. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to update this blog from time to time.</description>
