      <description>&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Git Push</title>

      <description>So I did the &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo; page. I believe there was a serious syntax error when I amended the about markdown file. I tried to copy the _index.md file in the example site. It worked. So, I just copy the whole thing again. That&amp;rsquo;s not a high level problem though.
And I deployed the hugo site on the Netlify server. To be clear, compiled the files in hugo locally (at the predator), push the site folder onto my git hub repository.</description>

      <title>Push to Github</title>

      <description>There is some problem when I try to push the project to git hub. I followed the Video &amp;lsquo;Understanding the Jamstack: How to build a blog with Hugo, Netlify CMS and Zapier, by How to Code on Youtube.
I created a Github account. Added a repository called &amp;ldquo;hugo-site&amp;rdquo;. Then, there is a series of command, which I don&amp;rsquo;t know the function.
I shall probably look at the hugo documentation on Deploying on Github.</description>

      <description>Downloaded Hugo, a static website generator, to update my learning, woodworking and others. Mainly in the form of blog posts. Want to get things out fast. Letting people see fast.
So basically, there is no log in system. No users. No Database. I guess the more complicated stuffs will go to my wiki page. https://wiki.gallerieboii.sbs
Anyways, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be an internet peasant anymore. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to update this blog from time to time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life. One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
