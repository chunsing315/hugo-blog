####Gallery and Art Spaces in Hong Kong and Taiwan
In my five years of working in the contemporary art gallery industry.  I curated and coordinated over 20 gallery exhibitions in the gallery from 2017 to 2021. Having the privilege of working with the uprising contemporary artist in Hong Kong, I develop incredible interest and a sense of mission to promote local artists and bring them to the center stage of the art world.  In the journey of participating in international major art fairs, I can curate exhibitions to present local artists on a big stage on a limited budget.  Some of the major art fairs I put my effort in are **Art Basel Hong Kong**, Art021 Shanghai 2018, the inaugural edition of Ink Now Taipei 2019, Asia Now 2019, and the inaugural edition of Frame Hong Kong 2019. Some of the collectors include a museum, Taiwanese art foundations, well known collectors from Korea and Japan,and first-time art collectors in Hong Kong.

I was given the chance to supervise the inaugural of several art spaces in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  In 2018,  I supervised the refurbishment of **A.M. Space** and manage the transition to **A Concept Gallery**.  I did a systematic transition in terms of the hardware and software of the gallery.  Furthermore, I was appointed as the gallery coordinator of the gallery and coordinated eight exhibitions until the hiatus of the gallery operation due to COVID-19.

I was appointed to supervise the unification of a.m. space to its parent company Art Map Ltd.  I liaised with the users of the space to design a productive workspace for the publishing and gallery operations.  The relocation increases the gallery space by 50%.  I subsequently curated an invited exhibition featuring 12 local contemporary ink artists.

After the establishment of the new space in Hong Kong, I participated in the preparation of the new compound space in Taiwan called **Yanben**.  It is an art space with a cafe, a hostel, and a gallery.  I participated in recruitment, interior design, and procurement in Hong Kong.  To establish the operations in Tainan, I was deployed in December 2020.  During my first three months, we broke the single-day revenue record of the space 3 times.  Establishing the business revenue model and improving on interior decoration with local architects.   I curated 3 exhibitions, organized 3 workshops, and coordinated 1 concert during my six-month stay, established standard operating procedures for cafe, hostel, and gallery business, and trained more than ten employees.  I was invited by a local university to talk about the business model of the company.
