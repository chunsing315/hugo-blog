Downloaded Hugo, a static website generator, to update my learning, woodworking and others.
Mainly in the form of blog posts. Want to get things out fast. Letting people see fast.

So basically, there is no log in system. No users.  No Database. I guess the more complicated stuffs will go to my wiki page.  https://wiki.gallerieboii.sbs

Anyways, I don't want to be an internet peasant anymore.  I guess I'll have to update this blog from time to time.

Interesting video to inspire this site is ali abdaal's take on "Show Your Work"(book). I remember reading the booking in 5 mins in 誠品.  Showing my process, my struggles and documenting everything along the journey, might be a thing to try out. 

In the verge of turning 27, I am working on several aspect of live, i.e.
1. Project Management, to manage a team of people upward and downward will help me go a long way which ever way I go.
2. Social Media Management, this skillset is the requirement by Hanart, the new gallery I am about to report to in three days.  It is a very well-reputed gallery and one of the oldest in town. So I would like to contribute to it.
3. Woodworking projects, every projects I encountered helped me grew a little with new skills and methodology.  I would love to document the project onwards to let other or the future team know the struggle I have a some points to notice.  It'd be a matrix of skills and maybe a school for city carpenter.
4. Reading list. As for my daily practice, a lot of the info comes from video format.  I would love to make summaries of interesting takeways from videos and books. The latest topics being Murakai's Men without Women and maybe the incident of X Museum.

Stay cool man.
