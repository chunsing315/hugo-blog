Art Practice is called practice because of its sports nature. Drawing and painting in Judy's studio and my studio respectively has stimulated the unfinished business of painting fundamental in 2014 or 2015. 

One of the three surviving paintings in that course is the first painting of a still life placed by Sarah Lai (the painter).   Somehow its survival indicates a particular aspect of my personality.

Through these years, I gained more exposure to paintings like Van Gogh(thanks to Lee Chi Tat), Toulouse-Lautrec, drawings from the dutch, the Chinese.  I wish to pick up right where we left of.

I just learnt that it took Ingres 8 years to finish a commissioned painting of Madam moitessier (family tragedy stop him from painting for two years in between).  It only took him  month to paint a portrait for a commission if he wanted.
