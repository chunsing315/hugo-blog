On JK's birthday, we went to Ma Wan for lunch and chilling.

We took a bus in Tsing Yi to Ma Wan.  It took us some time to find the bus terminal. It was quite fast.  We discussed about the marketing of her company, a local silverware boutique.  The omicrone situation hit the economy and the director made swift reaction to focus on the high-end jewelry for married couples because he deems that marriage is very hard to reschedule.  Cutting cost on middle-priced product seems to be a reasonable action.

There are some challenges on JK's collaborations with her colleagues because they have some disagreements on the marketing approach.  Her colleague thinks that high quality video will bring more customers to the company while JK thinks the audience is more interested in behind-the-scene stories.  The low engagement of the video posts on facebook and instagram suggests that the video is not an effective method.   Currently, the most effective posts seem to be the testimonials from the customers.  There sharing draws a lot of attentions and new customers.  However, they seem to struggle on retention of the customer.  In the marketing cycle, Awareness, Consideration, Purchase, Advocacy and Retention, retention is very effective for established business with lots of custoer base because the ROI of returning customer is way more than that of aquiring new ones.  The numbers show that it cost six times more to aquire new customers than to aquire returning customers  and the returning customers will spend 30% to 100% more than the new ones.

A direct message follow up is very likely to generate engagement.  In my experience, email marketing to boomer is a killing marteting tool, it's like an attractive woman in the club, everyone wants to talk to her.  First of all, the brand is someone you like. Secondly, it is updating you in a personal manner.  I find it very useful.  Even CEO replies to short personal DMs like that.

From the research [here](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/crm/customer-retention.shtml), there are five ideas for customer retention.
1. Engage with Customers (not just replying everything, find out the effective channels)
2. Reduce friction in the purchase process (reduce page load time, simplify checkout procedure)
3. improve customer support (live chat, dedicated telephone, email, social media, FAQ; In my opinion, a very large portion of the customer need some sort of support in the art gallery sector)
4. Create a community (membership exclusive programs, lecture/symopsiium where the company representative can interactive directly with the customers, live; each enagement equal loyalty in this setting)
5. Start a Loyalty program (It's different for gallery/jewelry business, as they are cyclicals.  The point is the increment in purchase frequency, there is not a standard quantity of frequency. Free products, or significant discounts can generate great loyal customers. The emotion here is the sense of reward.  One example is to arrouse the sense of reward by hinting the roadmap like 46/46 artworks or 10/10 set of collectibles.  Membership card, art fair tickets, magazine. The customer may find value )
In JK's case she may find out what the customers find valuable.  Young couples planning to get married and looking for memory making will find value in turism, education about marriage and entertainment.  They maybe interested in cafe coupon, museum tickets, movie screening events, wedding venue, bar venue, souvenirs for gifts, Car catalogues, concert tickets, photo-taking services, coffee making machines, photo-taking tools, wine tasting events, tea ceremony, art exhibiton. watch making.

JK and I stayed at Mawan for the whole afernoon. We had lunch at Oma's Kitchen, a German fusion restaurant by the sea.  JK had a roasted Chicken and I had seafood fried rice.  The coffee is not arabica, couldn't expect so much from a two people restaurant.  JK liked the waffle with ice cream, which reminds me of my barista days in Tainan.

We went back to the tree and looked at the artwork we made together.  I feel like making installation art is the most lovely thing a couple should do.  It challenges the couples in so many ways and is very fulfilling.  I did not expected to see the installation again.  It was a 3D drawing by rope.  We chose a few angles to create the illusion of drawings.

Everything closed that day, we went to the little pier to see the crane (or gazatta).   The solar park closed.  So we went to the Noah Park to take some photos with the flowers.  The bus took us to Tsuen Wan West.  We bought sushi and cake in Donki and the market.  We went to to the hotel at 7 something. than the unfortunate happened.

The receptionist told us that JK's residence has COVID positive cases and would not let us check in.  That hurt our perfect mood a bit.  We went back at the end.  We celebrate as usual.  Can't let that drag us down, that is just a little unfortune.
