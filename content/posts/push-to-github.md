There is some problem when I try to push the project to git hub. I followed the Video 'Understanding the Jamstack: How to build a blog with Hugo, Netlify CMS and Zapier, by How to Code on Youtube.

I created a Github account. Added a repository called "hugo-site".  Then, there is a series of command, which I don't know the function.

I shall probably look at the hugo documentation on Deploying on Github.

My another idea of deployment is to link the md files to my nextcloud notes.  then whenever the note is uploaded.  A new blog post will appear in the website.  I still don't know yet.

So far I will have to try the followings:
1. Deploy the website on Github
2. Deploy the website on Netlify
3. Create a simple CMS for content upload anywhere
4. finish the Disqus setup and form set up for comment function and email function.
5. Try nextcloud note integration. 
6. Uploading blog posts and portfolio for real.
7. SEO and Google Analytics Optimisation
