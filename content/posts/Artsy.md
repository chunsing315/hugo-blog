What can you do with a monthly fee of USD2700 monthly?

What is the hidden cost of Artsy? 
-Monthly or quarterly meeting with 2 senior management, 2 junior staff= 831.6 HKD/month
-Statistics review = 2 hour of senior management = 554.4
-uploading cost = 1 junior 4 hour per month = 554.4

Total = HKD 23000 monthly.

HKD 276,000 to only break even. You spent so much time to achieve nothing.  Is the lead yours? not really, you don't even have his number/ email. Artsy has it.
What support does it give you?

Say we sold a piece of 500,000 .  If we split 50:50 with the artist, we lose by 26,000

You can hire a mid level curator for a 6 show takeover.
You can hire a writer to apply for matching fund for a 600,000 fund to develop an in house eCommerce powerhouse. 
You can hire 2 copywriters to write a piece every single day to post on five channel and create a newsletter, having the direct contact of your lead. You can have as many "push notification ("it is a human direct message, a warm call, a written card")" as you want. In every single season and festival.

# Quit Artsy

Just fucking quit Artsy.  Gagosian invested in it, it aims to grap gallery's money only. (it cannot even take the advantage of the nft heat.)
