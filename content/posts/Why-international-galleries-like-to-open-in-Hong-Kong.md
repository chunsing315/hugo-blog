I was going through the gallery email. It's spam detection is really bad. There is a filtered called "SpamAssasin", but it only has like three keywords.  It is not helping. Can you imagine an international gallery using Thunderbird, an open-source email software as its daily drive? I mean it is so wonderful for a linux-supremacist like me.  I simply wish they switch to Linx as well.

Back to the topic. Artforum was asking the gallery to check the listing info. There is a new name I have never seen before in Wong Chuk Hang. 

The name is Denny Dimin Gallery. It was only found in 2013, the same year my previous employer found the small size gallery.  How lives can differ with different paths. While my ex-gallery was found in Aberdeen Sreet, Elizabeth Denny found the started in the Lower East Side of New York before moving to Tribeca in 2019. 

Tribeca is a new gallerist favorite. A land broker single-handedly bring all the hippest galleriest to the area.  I watched an influencer Mary Lynn's Youtube tour in a couple of galleries in the area. There is a young vibe in the construction of the space and the selection of artists (a juvenial taste). It is the Lower Manhattan New York. It was famous for the film festival.
