I was trying to write an article about my first client yesterday in my phone using the Netlify CMS, but apparently the markdown widget does not work very well in my phone.  The article was gone.  That hurts me a little bit.  But this situation happened to me over and over again.  The result has always been positive for some reason.  For example, I used to see the blue screen of Windows a lot in the University Library back in College.  One time a dear schoolmate press my power button mistakenly.  These situations turned out to be blessing in disguise.  I ended up writing better essays every single time. 

This time I will forget about the article and start working on the SQL database of me.  I drew the database tale and realised that it may turn out to be bigger than a spreadsheet of contact list.  It shall document the clients and every encounter.  That what the article was about.  A Taiwanese collector and 3 times we met. 

The database aims to achieve the folllowings:
1. Document the client encounters and corresponding strategy
1. calculate the effort/sales relationship
1. provide guidence on customer strategy
1. shine lights on other impact of the artist
1. magnify the disadvantage and improvement of handling approach
1. everyone on the list must at least have a page detailing the encounter. You are like Sherlock Holms,be very detailed about the situation.  Who else is there, what is in the room, what did the shareholder see? what is the interest here. What did you discussed?

With a couple of years of experience in the art gallery field, the list of people has outgrown my brain capacity.  A system is needed to fortify memory and prepare for  furture encounter.

Yet, be aware of the limitation of the effect of the encounter.  History and experience has a limited effect on the future or the outcome.  One successful gallerist should be able to learn from the mistakes, and move on to the next. 

Another limitation is the scope and capability of the existing knowledge, a reflection is necessary, but it won't compare to the experience of the more seasoned and successful practitioners.  Be humble and hungry to learn, from others' story and approach.
