In Philips Auction some years ago, the curator Alan Chna said he used the Suzhou Chinese Garden style to create the sense of "moving space" in an exhibiton. It aroused by curiousity. 

To research the topic, I want to find out the context of the concept.

-Suzhou
-Classic of Garden
-Classics of Chinese Building.

In Song Dynasty, 李誡《營造法式》there is a technical book recording the standards of Chinese Classical building.  I wonder what were the philosophy and aesthetics behind the building style of Chinese classic temples and palace.  What makes a beautiful rooftop, for example.  Were there catalogues of visual paradoxes and illusion. What was the attitude of the scholar or literati towards the illusionistic garden which in principle defies the Platonic Formal world into a pure visual/spatial play. What is the counterpart in fine arts, could it be caligraphy or painting in Xieyi styles?

There are some scholars on the topic of Chinese Garden. One of which almost became the founder of New Asia College, ending up starting a Garden desgin professional school in Taiwan, named Xiong.  some classics are 
*明 計成 著：《園冶》*
- 強調園林設計「三分匠、七分主人」。「主人」不是園主，而是主持的設計師。
- 尊重自然：「雖由人作，宛自天開。」
- 強調「造園無格，必須巧於因借，精在體宜」。
