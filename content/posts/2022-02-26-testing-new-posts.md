1. Feature image is not looking very good.   Maybe I will just delete it.
1. The pushed time is not listed in the list page. I don't like that.
1. Category and tags are missing.  That will soon be a problem.

There is one theme I like. But that would be a full-fledge company website.  I would  like this site to be a more blog site with links to the artwork. I am struggling between a portfolio page or a blog page.  They have different purposes.  There should be a way to integrate them (possibly with Hugo Component), but the existing themes will not satisfy my need. A deep-dive into hugo and css might be necessary. Which means, I am working on web dev as a side hustle in March.  That's ok considering the ease of doing it with the JAMstack technology.  There will be a lot of sitting around starring at the laptop. 

I looked at Alan Chan's Space27 and Michael Chu's Pill&Pillow Designs (worldclass).   The former has a very clean look with an interactive index of his clients.  Very classy. Pill&Pillow focuses on responsive design with a front page smoothly transiting to the story, which is the keyword here. 

The Art Nextpo website also showed up some how.  Displaying HKD100,000 (12000USD) art with price on the gallery website does not look good.

I looked at Artsy's site (found out the founder Cleveland was super young, the CEO now wrote about about setting targets in your career, a family guy). The problem with showing art online is quite apparent here. The "story" element is replaced with cold information.  Info is useful for gallerist like myself, to validate price and generate art consultancy advice with real value.  But for the art audience, they are less important. After all, only one person will own the artwrok at the end of the date.  There is a lot to learn from Pill&pillow.  And Artsy has a lot to do to fix this. (I know they are having an editorial team to generate stories, but it does not seem integrated with the displace of the OVR)  It is a good subject to talk about the correct way to display art online.  

Nerds are very exited to see database.  For that matter, I curated the [wiki](https://wiki.gallerieboii.sbs) where every single project is listed.  The wiki is a  open-source approach in hope that they can be recreated in the future.  Intant Hero (2016) signifies the creativeness and destructiveness of art.  My art has a tendency to not last, which I did not plan to achieve. They keep eixiting in ephemeral manners.  It is only reasonable to document them in an open source manner,detailing the making to whoever interested.  So far the Chiron is uploaded.   The writing machine and the Fuseli's Horse shall come next.

The thing I like about mediawiki (the engine for my wiki) is that it look terrible. It is obviously not suitable for client facing.  Whoever interested enough to go to that site is interested enough to research and investigate.  It is even better if they just steal my stuff to do better to the world.  I know, Elon Muskish, right?

With the documentation behind, I can focus on the story part or concept part of the presentation.  Sometims the documentation helps too.  The geneology is clearer now.  All projects are present in one content page.  Life can not be interesting enough to generate more than one wiki page. 

Next is the story, what story does gallerieboii tell?  How does the gallery adventure bring new insight to the lifestyle of a Gen-Z artist who fell in love with ancient technology.  How does the tension between creative and destructive, new and tradition, slow and fast, resolve?
