In the AWAAAARD, web design competition, the unconventionalgallery.ruinart.com ranks very high.  I was looking at successful design today and it came up to me and caught my eyeball.  I will tell you five reason it is a great story-telling website.

### Attention, It's a gallery
After you input your age, you realize it is a real gallery.  You are inside of the white cube The spatial design is minimalistic with  every checkpoint hinting more to explore.  There are 46 artworks by artist David Shirgley.  One may argue that they are more illustrations than art, but the casual online viewing experience plays very well with the pieces.  You don't really care about the quality of art.  The story and the humour of the pieces are more prominent in the representation.

The navigation is by scrolling up and down or drag and drop with the mouse.   The UX designer subtly leaves a millisecond of delay in the scolling.  It feels very smooth and real.  The Journey is controlled in the linear fashion, which means you are not allowed to walk around freely in the space.  I think it is more suitable for galleries than the MMO game style walking around for no reason (some websites even use "WSAD" for walking like in a open-world RPG), because it set the optimal viewing angle for every viewing angle, or scene.  Audience does not have to waste time or energy walking around.

The artworks fits well with the aspect ratio of the mobile phone, i.e. most of the works are in portrait. The text in the works is large enough for regular viewing without zooming in too much.  There is a traditioal info box with each work.  You may find the description of the work and a X/42 milestone.  That is quite clever because if you are interested you would want to watch them all.  Each infobox has a call-to-action button link to the IRL art fair calendar, which the contact form is located.   It is clear and to the point.


### Utilize 3D in a controlled manner
The 3D rendering of the gallery feels realistic with nice touches of real life lighting.  The lighting is perfect in every scene.  it feels like there is a window on the roof letting the sunlight pass through.   The warm tone makes the experience smooth and enjoyable. The route is very comfortable.  You can never grasp the whole space, nor can you draw a floor plan of the virtual space.  That suggests that the irrelevance of a floor plan (I always doubt the use of floor plan in exhibitions in replacement of the mighty caption)

There are a dark room showing neon work and a couple of holes connecting to "secret rooms" or "the grape yard".  It is just super easy in terms of building cost to make a room dedicated to a work, comparing to the IRL alternative.  Some "motifs" are shown repeatedly to create a sense of flow.

### Collaboration elevate the stupid art
David Shirgley is obviously a well established artist (with an OBE in his name), but his art is still stupid.   The artworks are all bite-size and retain the attention of the users.  It's like a one-liner comedy with setup and punches over and over.  You learn something along the way.  The space and the lack of effort in seeing this viewing room make the art justified.  The jokes are cheap, so is seeing the show.  They enjoy the luxury of museum lighting in the virtual environment.   If I were to see the booth in a real art fair, say Affordable Singapore, Art Basel Miami or Frieze LA, I would be more interested to see the works again close up.

### A journey encourages exploration
The journey design curated some check points such as wallpaper downloading page and a grape yard VR.  These pages appear in the website in a linear fashion, i.e. that is not link to the wallpaper downloading page.  Users must walk through the exhibits to "discover" the page.  It create a journey in the exhibition.  The IRL counter part would be a second floor of a gallery.  This could be further explored in museum exhibitions. 46 artworks are a lot for any physical exhibitions, how to encourage exploration to create a sense of achievement among viewer in order to leave a long term effect on the users.

### Only ask for one thing: IRL connection
All artworks want you to see the art fair connection IRL.  The page said that RUINART is really collaborating with art fair to provide alcohol support in internation events.  The website does not as for any purchase.   Which means the target of this website is focused only on awareness.
It also links to the Ruinart main site for other commission projects.

### Bonus: generative music
The music is very subtly generative with repetitive bars.  Sometimes it responds when you click on certain pages.  The site is obviously over engineered. I think the web dev team must have some fun with this project.
