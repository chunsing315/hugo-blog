1. What is not documenta?
The Degenerate Art Exhibition in 1937 is definitely not documenta. I am not saying it is the opposite, which is the official exhibition organized by the Nazis right next to the degenerate art exhibition.

Artists like Chagall, Paul Klee were listed by the Nazis as degenerates.

Hitler hated modern art. He thought that art is a representation of the "real world". The highest form of art should be the paintings in postcard, which he was capable of painting.

The exhibition of degenerate art accuminated 3 million visitors. It was supposed to mock the art. History tells us that all members of the exhibiton is on the right side of history.  And the censoring effort by the Nazis contributed to the success and recognitions in later years of the so-called degenerate art.  

Artworks were hung skewed and unframed.  The graffitis on the wall ridicules the paintings being made by mad artists.  In the Nazi's Perspectives, the ideology behind modern art is against the aesthetics of German art. The Nazis blamed the Expressionism for Germany's economic suffering after the Great Depression.

The Nazis confiscated over 16,000 pieces of artwork and organized a funeral exhibit in the name of "Degenerate Art" to kill the idea of self-expression.  The spacing was claustrophobic and uncomfortable in order to discredit the artistic output of the painters at the time.

It was the biggest art exhibition in Germany.
