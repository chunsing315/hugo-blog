The idea of a Cantonese podcast has been around my head for years.  When I was working in a gallery, the most valuable chit-chat is the art world gossips. In a very short period of time, the company I worked in had subscribe to magazines such as ArtTouch, Art Newspaper, Mingpao and other art-related publications.  They provide valuable information on art trends, mainly about museum shows, art festivals and big gallery moves. A practitioners can benefits from the information to make better decisions on curation, artist liaision, social media writings, avoiding artworld mistake, learning about art history, generating ideas for art-related activities, seeing possible sponsorships, learning about potential clients, collecting information of the writers.  

The values from the reading activity can be transferred to a podcast form.

The existing podcasts are Daoju(Mandarin), ArtMatter(Mandarin), TalkArt(English).  There is a space in Cantonese art talk on art business. The similar competitors are Oraora Talk (Facebook), Artmap IG Live (IG, interview), 新城電台(radio), RTHK哲學有偈傾, Canadian Chinese art PHD (youtube). The local art podcasts are either more academic or business focus.

I want to create a program that I find useful.  I was a young gallerist who was interested in the collection of art and the tastemaker in the business more than the perspective of an artist. 

The topic I am interested in focusing on will be:
1. intro of gallerists- Hauser,Gagosian,Hanart,Beijing
2. info of shows in town- 5 exhibition (local first, commercial first)
3. gallery business number breakdown
4. audience etiquettes
5. contemporary art movements
6. art awards
7. biennale
8. understanding cool kids

Things I do not do in the show:
1. critique art
2. the how-to in art
3. represent artists
4. be academic

A ten-minute time-frame:
00-00 summary
01-05 Topic
05-06 Sponsor? if not this session will be a trick.
06-08 Punch/the takeaway
08-10 shows
