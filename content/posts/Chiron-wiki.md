Uploaded the documentation to my wiki. https://wiki.gallerieboii.sbs/ . Thanks to the requests of Y park and pointsman, The materials were ready a long time ago.

About the entire sculpture camp project, I am very grateful for the experience.

First of all, I had tremendous support from the pointsman team.  Three technicians became good friends of mine. They are Baba, Ding and Chuen.  Very supportive and safety-savy.

The whole Chiron concept is very literal- it's just a concept. As far as I am concern right now, concept is the least important issue right now.  Being hungry on creating for a couple of years as a gallerist, I am fully of ideas from 2017 to 2021 in my head.  They are free associated images in my head about relationship, machanics and spirituality.  Most of them are in the same stream of thought started in my final year of study as an art student in CUHK. Some of them are very immature thought, or youthful thought (to be nice).

Since graduation, my mind has pointed more towards craftsmanship and antiquity. Since the gallery I worked in located in Hollywood Road, where the best antique shops in town are. I was always fascinated by the ancient joinery technique displayed in the windows. I leant those technique on Youtube from a guy named 辛全新, a master carpenter in Tianjin.  The technique influence my understanding of object creation and durability of art.
