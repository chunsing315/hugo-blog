The german tech entreprenuer Magnus represents the  milenials art lovers.  But he revert to the same argument of the artworld being closed-door, which is not a solvable problem.

In the presentation, he addresses a lot of insightful numbers of the stagnant growth of the total sales of the art market despite the growth of wealth in total.  The dominant of white-male (usually American) exclude the variety in the bottom up art scene. Those number clearly indicate the problem of the artworld being non-sustainable.

He also points out the white cube being off-putting and a barrier to the newcomer.  He sites the genesis of gallery in neo-classical period of a salonistic frame shop style period.  Such style of an art gallery is the most popular of Vincent van Gogh's time.  In fact, he worked in his uncle's Gallery Groupie & Cie when he was a teenager.  The multi-national corporation is selling secular paintings and prints in a solon gallery-style.  Walls are either red or blue with not much space between paintings.  The ceilings were at least 4 meters high to maximize the number of works displayable.
