Curated by Peter  Fischli

Fischli curated the exhibition to answer the five so-called "Ruptures"  in the notion of painting.

1. Photography took the representation from painting

2. Readymade and collage further illegitimize the notion of representation.  When the object itself becomes art, or has the potentiality of being so.

3. Authorship is under attack. quoting and appropriation for the first time take over image invention.

4. Painting is the best commodity that represents a bourgeois morals. Painting is by nature conservative.

5. Avant-guard was eaten/absorbed by the market in the neoliberal 80s.

Painting is having an afterlife right now. The question is if we are in heaven or in hell.  Fischli said contemporary painting is a Frankenstein with perfect plastic surgery.  Constant changing environment makes the distribution becomes the most efficient form, a continuous circulation on screens. 

The aura is back in the new circumstances.  They are illuminated in the media condition with the help of tech.
