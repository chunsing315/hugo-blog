The book begins with a visual expereiential break down of the perspective on the horizon vs that of the vertical axis.

O'Doherty on landscape paintings, beach paintings and the horizon.  What is the impact of the horizontal line in a painting.

He covers a lot of grounds from the genesis of the 'wall' from the salon in fench to minimalism in the first chapter. There is a cultural original traced back to church or greek temple where the gallery is the sacred place.

The essential difference between easel painting and mural is subtle or psycological. The depth in the perspective in mural paintings seem to be shallower while the movable wall in easel painting suggest window-shape limitation and its hints to a much deeper space.

He slams on Cubism and the impressionist for glorifying or extending the life of the easel painting despite its revolution in the outer frame (in latter years).  Abstract expressionism being a system for the ease of classification omits the opposition (or eliminate in some case).  Sometime the opposition is strong like in that of matisse.

He said the problem in the 60s is not targeting on paintings, but the easel.  Thus we have the inductive and deductive method seen in Frank Stella's irregular shape.

Courbet being the first modernist who had to editorialise his own work in his one man outsider show outside of the salon.

He talks about how much space does a work need to "breathe", then he goes on to bring up minimalist that challenge the "edge" of the space.

I need to go over again what does he mean by the horizontal line breaking the frame within a frame (Paintings by fedrich)

The first chapter ends in the praise of William Anastasi.
