I came aross the article in Artnet[1] reporting that David Zwirner employed a Millenials influencer for the social media marketing manager.  It interests me to look into the online strategy of the International Gallery. Let's break down the business with 708k followers on IG.

Below is the list of all internet initiatives of DW:
1. Online Viewing Room.  The Chinese version is a Weixin landing page. While the original is a website dedicated to the works with stories and works images. There is a email form as a wall to entry.
1. Podcast- It seems to be a weekly show for 6 week every year. They invite big name cultural elite to discuss the works or the artists. 
1. IG - each stream has its own social media account
1. David Zwirner Books
1. Platform.com
1. 52 Walker.com - a [kunsthalle](/posts/kunsthalle.md) style gallery space curated by Ebony L. Hynes (Artreview 35/100) in Tribeca.  An edition of Clarion, the gallery's pulbication is accompanying each exhibiton highlighting the scholarship and research on the exhibition.

In 2018, the gallery has reported 30% of the sales were done solely on emailed images.  I don't expect the number going down. The international gallery is averaging 12 to 20 art fairs yearly.  If a booth fee alon e is USD30,000, The cost of an exhibition is at least USD90,000.  The yearly budget on art fair would be around USD1,440,000. If 30% of the sales are pure online.  It would be wise to match the budget because the cost of online marketing is 1/6 of that of IRL. It means an optimal monthly budget would be USD37,000. The most outrageous Youtube marketer have USD10,000 monthly budget on Youtube Ads. Which leaves us with USD16,000 to use. It would be enough for project like, 3D scanning the show (1000), professional video production (3,000), Podcast with paid guest (4*400), 2 interns for content maintenance (2x500), interactive website (5000). You do excellent SEO, email marketing.  You can pay scholar to write about your show.  You can even publish a decent magazine (heck, maybe it can fund itself even). Pay a student designer and work him/her to death with all design works for website, magazine, email, instagram posts.  

I am not going to dive into the awareness generation part of the business (that's a very big issue). The following grew from 350k to 700k in 4 years time which is a 25% growth each year. The trend is not flattening yet. We will talk about the content in the future.

The Platform is an interesting concept.  Basically, it is a lesser version of David Zwirner Gallery or it's affordable eCommerce version.  It states clearly in their terms page that they are a eCommerce platform.  The special thing is that they are working exclusively with artist run galleries which combine to a list of around 40 worldwide.  Paintings doinated the page and all artworks are well shot. When your mouse hover over the artwork, a picture of the selected picture in an interior setting is shown to let the user the idea of the size of the piece. 

There is a editorial section in the website, which shows a "curator" or celebrity's pick.  It really comes down to the taste of the "curator" here because there is minimal text on the rationale behind the selection of the artworks.  It looks like anyone can have their own selection and create a John Doe's Pick of the Month.  The animation design feels comfortable and not clustered. You could argue that it is better than sites like Artsy and Saatchi in two ways.  First, It clearly draws the line between the main gallery and ecommerce.  Art Gallery business is a luxury and would not work in an eCommerce setting (the online payment system is not geared for the amount for the transaction of serious artworks).
Secondly, it is a philantropic act to support artist run-space with the association with the name of DW. Lower-tiered collector can build a habit of collecting contemporary work in this setting.
In terms of the cost of running the whole thing, You can definately achieve more with a inhouse ecommerce platform, while Artsy and Saachi could not justify the monthly cost of listing. In my memory, the cost of Artsy partnership is USD10,000 yearly. All the gallery gets are listing in a sea of gallery, editorial opportunity.  You have to pay for extra if you want spotlight in the viewing room. Looking at the report, the difference in preference in purchasing in  between Art Marketplace and gallery official site is only 1 to 2% at around 50%. The number of customers who are willing to purchase on social media is only a few percents behind. You can do a lot more with the same budget. As listed above, it is more than enough to make your own website in a year.
Funny enough, David Zwirner is still on Artsy. They don't seem to update the page fully. You can find info on the art fairs and a viewing room of Frieze LA. DW is simply doing too well in the art fairs the editorials have to mention their name over and over again in posts.  It puts them in an embarrasing situation because big gallery does not find it useful and small gallery won't benefit much from the marketplace

DW Books,I don't have time to check out. Maybe discuss in the future..
